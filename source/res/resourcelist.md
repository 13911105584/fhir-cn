Additional Resources will be added in the future. A list of hypothesized resources can be found on the 
[HL7 wiki](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Resource_Types "FHIR_Resource_Types").  Feel free to add any you think are missing or engage with one 
of the [HL7 Work Groups](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/index.cfm) to submit a 
[proposal](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Category:FHIR_Resource_Proposal "Category:FHIR_Resource_Proposal") to define a resource of particular interest.
