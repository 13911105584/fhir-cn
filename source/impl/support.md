## <span class="sectioncount">2.7<a name="2.7"> </a></span> Implementation Support

This page is a registry of the various places where support for 
implementations can be found.

### <span class="sectioncount">2.7.1<a name="2.7.1"> </a></span> Asking Questions

In the first place, implementation questions - how do I do X? - should be asked
on StackOverflow.com using the tag [hl7_fhir]. 

[Stack Overflow Questions about FHIR](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hl7_fhir).

Note that you should not use Stack Overflow to discuss specification design issues. This is a Stack
Overflow rule - see [guidance](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/3966/is-it-okay-to-use-stack-overflow-as-the-support-forum-for-a-product-or-project) about this.

If your question is about why the specification is how it is, probably the best place to 
start is the [FHIR wiki](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR "FHIR"), which is the 
home for the FHIR development team. Active discussions are found on the [FHIR email list](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions "FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions").
The development team hangs out on Skype, and you can ask to join the (busy) skype channel. 

### <span class="sectioncount">2.7.2<a name="2.7.2"> </a></span> External Links of Interest

This general collection of links may also provide additional helpful information:

*   The Twitter Hashtag is [#FHIR](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23FHIR)
*   [List of publicly available Test Servers &amp; Clients](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing "Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing") (note that the servers are not always current with this specification - cross-check the versions in their conformance statements with this spec (v0.2.1))
*   Several of the project team have blogs, though some of these cover more than just FHIR:

        *   [Health Intersections](http://www.healthintersections.com.au)
    *   [The FHIR Place](http://thefhirplace.com/)
    *   [Hay On FHIR](http://fhirblog.com/)
