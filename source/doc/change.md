# 信息学在被动式医疗向主动式医疗转变中的作用 

正如JohnSnow利用信息学的一个分支和地理位置分析来确定霍乱在伦敦的病源地，进而在1854年证明了胚种学说，带来了医学革命，信息学的应用和相关技术在下一次的医疗卫生领域的变革中也是很有帮助的.

Just as John Snow used a branch of informatics, geospatial analysis, to identify the source of cholera in London and so prove the germ theory and revolutionise medicine in 1854, so too will the application of informatics and associated technology be instrumental to the next big change in healthcare.

所有发达国家都面临着老龄化和慢病引发的需求增加。很多也缺乏有经验的从业人员。越来越多的证据指出可避免的医疗过失给健康系统造成了很大的损失。事实上，即使在最好的医疗系统 最好的护理也要占大约一半的时间。即使能够持续地比我们现在能做到的做得更好也不足以解决可持续医疗卫生所面临的迫在眉睫的危机。

All countries with advanced economies are facing increased demand from ageing populations and increased chronic disease.  Many also have shortages of skilled workers.  Mounting evidence points to avoidable errors causing serious harm in health systems.  Indeed optimal care only occurs about half the time in even the best performing health systems (1).  Doing more of what we do now just a little better, even if that is continuous, will not be enough to address the looming crisis in sustainable healthcare. 

医疗卫生、生物学、信息技术以及相关的社会变革和经济学的结合带来的模式上转变也许正是答案。信息学能够在诸多方面发挥作用。下图总结了这些趋势，以及从被动式向主动式医疗转变的可能的结果。

Convergence of trends in health care, biology, informatics and technology together with the associated social changes and economic imperative is driving a paradigmal shift (2) that may be the answer.  Informatics has a role in most aspects of this.  The figure below provides a summary of the convergence of these trends and the likely results of disruption that will move us from reactive to proactive healthcare.

就我们对physiological pathways的理解,信息学已经成为分子生物学的主要工具，比如 花在计算机上的时间和在实验室中做基因测序的三倍。信息学用在神经网络的映射，构建精度和复杂度都迅速提高的系统生物学模型，这在没有电脑的帮助下是无法完成的。我们的认识变化如此之快，最近美国科学院认为这将成为一个新的学科。 

In terms of our understanding of physiological pathways, informatics is now the major tool of molecular biology with for example a 3 to 1 ratio in time spent computing versus chemistry for gene sequencing.  Informatics is being used to map neural networks and to build the models of systems biology (3) with ever increasing levels of precision and complexity that simply can’t be done without the help of machines. Our understanding has changed so much recently that the American Academy of Science is now arguing that it is time for a new taxonomy (4).

便宜的移动计算、传感器和设备促进了由于社会的变化、生物学知识的不断增长所带来的个性化的发展。这样的一些社会性驱动力和实现技术使得更多非专家人士参与到决策、治疗、发现和知识管理的过程中.

Greater knowledge about how we think (5), advances in the information sciences and availability of computing power has meant our capacity to acquire knowledge and use it to predict the course of pathology has increased enormously and it is just as well because the explosion of information is impossible to deal with otherwise. These new methods can be used to provide better advice and to better prevent disease through discovery, monitoring and treatment.

更深入的了解人类如何思考村级了信息科学的发展，促进了计算能力的可及性，这意味着我们获取知识，使用知识来预测病理过程的能力极大地提升了，这也是好事，因为单单的信息爆炸式是无法实现的。这些新方法可以用在提供更好的建议，通过疾病发现更好的预防疾病，更好的管理和治疗疾病。

在线诊疗，真正的将质量测度和知识集成到工作流中，这些看起来有点像信息技术利用的第二阶段，医疗卫生系统自身也能从中受益。尽管保持公开性和透明性，仍然存在竞争，在良好的测度之下，pay-for-success契约方式可作为一个积极的影响因素。

医疗卫生领域大规模的改革是基本的 也是不可避免的。看起来 生物学和信息的革命所导致的知识和机器的融合促使被动式治疗向主动式个性化治疗的转变。只有借由这些重要现象，我们所需的医疗卫生的效率、效益才能得到改善。
Large scale change in the way healthcare is done is both essential and inevitable.  It is likely that this will derive from the merging of the knowledge and machines of the biological and information revolutions facilitating a shift from reactive treatment to proactive personalised medicine.  Only by such significant phenomenon could the quantum improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare which is needed come.

数字化技术的发展已经破坏了其他部门，特别是媒体业、制造业和零售业，医疗行业也逃不过此劫。生物学和医疗健康的数字化将使得机器可以帮助我们揭开疾病神秘的面纱，实现医疗健康的民主化，从疾病治疗向健康的促进和管理转变。
The development of digital technology has disrupted other sectors, notably media, retail and manufacturing, and the health sector is unlikely to remain immune (6).  Digitisation of biology and health will allow machines to help, lead to a demystification of disease, the democratisation of healthcare, and a move from the treatment of disease to the promotion and maintenance of wellness.
