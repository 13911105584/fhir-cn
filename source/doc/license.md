### <span class="sectioncount">1.2.1<a name="1.2.1"> </a></span> Disclaimer and Warning of Use

FHIR Resource definitions developed by HL7 are derived from the considerable collective 
experience of the HL7 membership and wide community feedback from the development and 
application of a spectrum of health care interoperability solutions.  However, Resource 
definitions are generalized to support multiple contexts of use. It is the responsibility 
of the persons or organizations using these Resources to ensure their use is fit for the 
particular purpose in which they are used, including validation for clinical and operational use.

### <span class="sectioncount">1.2.2<a name="1.2.2"> </a></span> FHIR License

FHIR plain English license:

*   FHIR is &copy; and &reg; HL7. The right to maintain FHIR remains vested in HL7
*   You can redistribute FHIR
*   You can create derivative specifications or implementation-related products and services
*   Derivative Specifications cannot redefine what conformance to FHIR means
*   You can't claim that HL7 or any of its members endorses your derived [thing] because it uses content from this specification
*   Neither HL7 nor any of the contributors to this specification accept any liability for your use of FHIR

Note: Why not use a standard open source license? We'd like to use [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) or 
[a license listed here](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical), but none of them actually deliver on 
the plain English intent above in important ways because they are suitable for software, not standards. 
We aspire to meet [these requirements from the Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/osr-intro), 
though [patents are a problem](http://xml.coverpages.org/patents.html). 

While we resolve the questions around the long term license, the following license,
adapted from the [OMG](http://www.omg.org) (thanks for allowing this), applies:

> Subject to all of the terms and conditions below, HL7 hereby grants you a fully-paid up,

> 
> HL7 is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may authorize developers, suppliers and 
> sellers of computer software or specifications to use certification marks, trademarks or other 
> special designations to indicate compliance with FHIR. Software developed under the 
> terms of this license may claim compliance or conformance with FHIR if and only 
> if the software compliance is of a nature fully matching the applicable conformance points as 
> stated in the FHIR specification. Software developed only partially matching the applicable 
> compliance points may claim only that the software was based on FHIR, but may 
> not claim compliance or conformance with this specification. In the event that testing suites 
> or processes are implemented or approved by HL7, Inc., software developed using this 
> specification may claim compliance or conformance with the FHIR specification only if the 
> software satisfactorily completes the testing suites.
